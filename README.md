# todoApp

A simple app made for checking daily tasks.

Due to a massive loss of time and effort to fix some cors and connection issues, I was left with not enough time to finish the assignment. The assignment wasn't difficult, but I used a lot of things for the first time, and since not everything went well on the first try, it is very incomplete.

The backend should be alright though, with maybe slight modifications left while finishing the front.

The frontend is a mess since it's not complete. However it can successfuly communicate with the backend using axios, the login works fine, so is the fetching. Further on, there was not a lot of potential problems such as the one with CORS so I think it only needs detailed work and finishing the pages, with slight hook manipulation for alerting before task expiration (the irony), and the lazy loading of the task list.
